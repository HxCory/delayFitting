# delayFitting
Calculates photoionization time delays in resonant two photon ionization

Contains xcode project for build in the PerturbationTheory project contained within '/Source'

Run the 'PerturbationTheory' project, and then run 'plotDelay.py' to graph time delays vs central frequency of ionizing pulse.
